## Introduction

This project originated as an intern project and is still available at [github.com/Javier090/k8s-pdb-autoscaler](https://github.com/Javier090/k8s-pdb-autoscaler).

The general idea is that Kubernetes (k8s) deployments already have a max surge concept, and there's no reason this surge should only apply to new deployments and not to node maintenance or other situations where PodDisruptionBudget (PDB)-protected pods need to be evicted.
This project uses node cordons or, alternatively, an eviction webhook to signal PDBWatcher Custom Resources that map to a PodDisruptionBudget. A controller then attempts to scale up a deployment that corresponds to the PodDisruptionBudget.

### Why Not Overprovision?

Overprovisioning isn't free. Sometimes it makes sense to run as cost-effectively as possible, but you still don't want to experience downtime due to a cluster upgrade or even a VM maintenance event.  

Your app might also experience issues for unrelated reasons, and a maintenance event shouldn't result in downtime if adding extra replicas can save you.



## Features

- **Node Controller**: Signals PDBWatchers for all pods on cordoned nodes selected by PDBs.
- **Optional Webhook**: Signals PDBWatcehrs for any pod getting an evicted. See [issue #10](https://github.com/paulgmiller/k8s-pdb-autoscaler/issues/10) for more information.
- **PDB Watcher Controller**: Watches PDBWatcher resources. If there a recent eviction singals and the PDB's AllowedDisruotions is zero, it triggers a surge in the corresponding deployment.
- **Scaledown**: The PDB Watcher Controller restores the deployment to its original state after a cooldown period when eviction signals stop.
- **PDB Controller** (Optional): Automatically creates PDBWatcher Custom Resources for existing PDBs.
- **Deployment Controller** (Optional): Creates PDBs for deployments that don't already have them.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- kind for e2e tests.
- A sense of adventure

### Install

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulgmiller/k8s-pdb-autoscaler.git
cd k8s-pdb-autoscaler
hack/install.sh
```

## Usage
Here's how to see how this might work.

```bash
kubectl create ns laboratory
kubectl create deployment -n laboratory piggie --image nginx
# unless disabled there will now be a pdb and a pdbwatcher that map to the deployment
# show a starting state
kubectl get pods -n laboratory
kubectl get poddisruptionbudget piggie -n laboratory -o yaml # should be allowed disruptions 0
kubectl get pdbwatcher piggie -n laboratory -o yaml
# cordon
NODE=$(kubectl get pods -n laboratory -l app=piggie -o=jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.nodeName}')
kubectl cordon $NODE
# show we've scaled up
kubectl get pods -n laboratory
kubectl get poddisruptionbudget piggie -n laboratory -o yaml # should be allowed disruptions 1
kubectl get pdbwatcher piggie -n laboratory -o yaml
# actually kick the node off now that pdb isn't at zero.
kubectl drain $NODE --delete-emptydir-data --ignore-daemonsets

```
Here's a drain of  Node on a to node cluster that is running the [aks store demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) (4 deployments and two stateful sets). You can see the drains being rejected then going through on the left and new pods being surged in on the right.
